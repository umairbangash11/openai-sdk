# openai-sdk
SDK Overview

The SDK is a lightweight, Python-centric tool designed to simplify working with agents and language models. It balances ease of use with powerful customization, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced users.

Design Principles





Balanced Simplicity: Offers essential features for effectiveness while keeping the learning curve minimal, like a well-organized toolbox with just the right tools.



Ready Yet Customizable: Works seamlessly out of the box with smart defaults but allows full customization, similar to a car with cruise control you can override manually.

Key Features





Agent Loop: Automatically manages workflows by:





Calling tools (e.g., functions or services).



Sending results to the language model (LLM).



Continuing until the task is complete, acting as an efficient assistant.



Python-First: Uses standard Python to orchestrate agents, avoiding new abstractions, so you can control agents with familiar code.



Handoffs: Enables smooth task delegation between multiple agents, like a relay race where each agent passes the baton.



Guardrails: Runs parallel safety checks to validate inputs and halt execution if issues arise, acting as a lifeguard for your workflows.



Function Tools: Transforms any Python function into a tool with automatic schema generation and Pydantic-powered validation, seamlessly integrating your code.



Tracing: Provides visibility into workflows for debugging and monitoring, with support for OpenAI’s evaluation and fine-tuning tools, like a GPS for your system.

Summary

The SDK simplifies agent and language model workflows with Python, automating complex tasks while offering flexibility. It’s easy to learn yet powerful for advanced use cases.
